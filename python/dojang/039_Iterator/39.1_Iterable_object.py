# Iterator: object which you can extract values in turn

# ================================================================================
# You don't create 100 number of numbers
# But you create an iterator which you extract values from 0 to 99
# Data generation is delayed, which is called lazy evaluation
# for i in range(100):
#   print(i)

# ================================================================================
# Iterable object: 
# 1. Object which has __iter__()
# 2. string, list, dictionary, set, etc
