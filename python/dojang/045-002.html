# We will judge if string is composed of numbers
# For that, we use range of number into squared bracket and we append * or + at the end of ]
# Range of number can be denoted as "0-9"
# * means judging if number is contained over 0 times
# + means judging if number is contained over 1 times

# Since there is number ranged from 0 to 9 over 0 times in '1234', patter of '[0-9]*' is matched with '1234'
re.match('[0-9]*', '1234')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 4), match='1234'>
# Since there is number ranged from 0 to 9 over 1 times in '1234', patter of '[0-9]*' is matched with '1234'
re.match('[0-9]+', '1234')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 4), match='1234'>
# Since there isn't number ranged from 0 to 9 over 1 times in '1234', patter of '[0-9]*' isn't matched with '1234'
re.match('[0-9]+', 'abcd')

@
# How to use difference between * and +

# Since there is 'a' over 0 times in 'b', patter of 'a*b' is matched with 'b'
re.match('a*b', 'b')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='b'>
# Since there isn't 'a' over 1 times in 'b', patter of 'a+b' isn't matched with 'b'
re.match('a+b', 'b')
# Since there is 'a' over 0 times in 'aab', patter of 'a*b' is matched with 'aab'
re.match('a*b', 'aab')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 3), match='aab'>
# Since there is 'a' over 1 times in 'aab', patter of 'a+b' is matched with 'aab'
re.match('a+b', 'aab')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 3), match='aab'>

# 'b' in pattern of "a*b" and "a+b" denotes must-have character in target string to be mathced with pattern 'b' 
# Since a* should be over 0 times in string to be matched, a* can be matched with 'b'
# But since a+ should be over 1 times in string to be matched, a+ can't be matched with 'b'

# Patterns of a*b and a+b are matched with 'ab', 'aab', 'aaab'


@
# We use * and + to judge sequence of characters
# We use ?(0 or 1) and .(1) to judge one character

# There is 0 or 1 character behind "H", pattern 'H?' is matched with 'H'
re.match('H?', 'H')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='H'>
# There is 0 or 1 character behind "H", pattern 'H?' is matched with 'Hi'
re.match('H?', 'Hi')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='H'>
# There is 1 character behind "H", pattern 'H.' is matched with 'Hi'
re.match('H.', 'Hi')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 2), match='Hi'>

# When you want to find the number of character(number) in target string, you use [range]{quantity}
# Pattern '[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}' is matched with '010-1000-1000'
re.match('[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}', '010-1000-1000')

@
# This syntanx [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4} can be used to designate range of frequency
# [0-9]{2,3}-[0-9]{3,4}-[0-9]{4}
# 2 : starting of range
# 3 : ending of range

# Pattern frequency from 2 to 3, frequency from 3 to 4, 4 is matched with '02-100-1000'
re.match('[0-9]{2,3}-[0-9]{3,4}-[0-9]{4}', '02-100-1000')

# When you want to find special characters(*, +, ?, ., ^, $, (, ) [, ], -, etc), you use \ in front of special characters(*, +, ?, ., ^, $, (, ) [, ], -, etc)
# You don't need to use \ in front of special characters(*, +, ?, ., ^, $, (, ) [, ], -, etc) in [ ]

# \w: is identical to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Alphabet characters, numbers, underscore character

# We will deal with white space
# Whitespace can be denoted by ' ', \s, \S

# \s is identical to [ \t\n\r\f\v]

# \S is identical to [^ \t\n\r\f\v]
# not including ' ', including \t, \n, \r, \f, \v

# Since there is character from [a-zA-Z0-9 ] over 1 times(+) in 'Hello 1234', pattern '[a-zA-Z0-9 ]+' is matched with 'Hello 1234'
# I denote whitespace by ' '

# Tip
# It's not efficient to designate same regular expression pattern in match() and search()
# If you use same regular expression pattern in match() and search(), it's beneficial to make same regular expression pattern as regular expression object by using compile() and then I can invoke match() and search() on that object

# I create regular expression pattern as object
p = re.compile('[0-9]+')
# I invoke match() with passing target string '1234' on instance p
p.match('1234')
# <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 4), match='1234'>
# I invoke search() with passing target string 'hello' on instance p
p.search('hello')
