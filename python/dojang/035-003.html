def calc():
    a = 3
    b = 5
    def mul_add(x):
        return a * x + b
    # After you created mul_add(),
    # you can return this mul_add()
    # When you return method, you don't append parenthesis next to name of method
    return mul_add

@
# Let's use closure methodology
# Since calc() returns mul_add(), variable c is assigned to by mul_add()
# Then, you can invoke c with passing argument, then you can see return value
c = calc()
print(c(1), c(2), c(3), c(4), c(5))
# output:
# 8 11 14 17 20

# Let's think
# calc() is terminated its scope
# But we can use local variable a and b of calc()

# Closure means method which is stored in c
# Closure means method(c) which uses preserved environment around method c(local variable a and b of calc(), code, etc) when we invoke that method(c)

@
# Like above explanation, we can store flow of program into variable
# Especially, we use closure when we want to hide internal data

@
# Closure can be made as lambda

def calc():
    a = 3
    b = 5
    # We return lambda expression rather than method
    return lambda x: a * x + b
 
c = calc()
print(c(1), c(2), c(3), c(4), c(5))
# output:
# 8 11 14 17 20

# You can use closure more easily by using lambda

# Don't confuse with lambda and closure
Lambda is anonymous method which doesn't have method name
# Closure is method which keeps environment wrapping that method, and then, that method uses environment when it's invoked


@
# If you want to change local variable of closure,
# you can use nonlocal keyword

@
다음은 a * x + b의 결과를 함수 calc의 지역 변수 total에 누적합니다.

def calc():
    a = 3
    b = 5
    total = 0
    # This method will become closure
    def mul_add(x):
        # total local variable of mul_add() closure will be used
        # as local variable of calc()
        nonlocal total
        total = total + a * x + b
        print(total)
    return mul_add

# I make closure and assign it into c
c = calc()
c(1)
c(2)
c(3)
# output:
# 8
# 19
