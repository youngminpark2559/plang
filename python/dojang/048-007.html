048-007. using metaclass<br/>
<xmp>
@
# Metaclass is class which creates class

# In metaclass, there are 2 kind
# First one is way of dynamically creating class by using "type"
# Second one is way of implementing metaclass by inheriting "type"

@
# We make class by specifying "name of class as string", "base class as tuple", "property and method(which can be denoted as lambda expression) as dictionary" inside of type

# type can be used when you find type of object(class)
# type can be used when you create class

class = type('name of class', tuple_of_base_class, dictionary_for_property_and_method)

# I create class "Hello" by using "type"
Hello = type('Hello', (), {})
print(Hello)
# output:
# <class '__main__.Hello'>

# I create "Hello instance" by using class "Hello"
h = Hello()
print(h)
# output:
# <__main__.Hello object at 0x029B4750>


@
# type('Hello', (), {}) creates class named Hello, whose class doesn't have base class, whose class doesn't have property and method
# You can create instance from this class

@
# You can put property and method into class
# You can use inheritance

# Let's try make class which has "property and method", "base class"

# The following code creates class which inherits "list", which has desc property and replace()

# First, I need to define replace() which will be put into class
def replace(self, old, new):
    while old in self:
        self[self.index(old)] = new
 
# I create AdvancedList class
# This class inherits list
# This class has property desc and replace()
AdvancedList = type('AdvancedList', (list, ), { 'desc': 'upgraded list', 'replace': replace })

# I give list to AdvancedList instance
x = AdvancedList([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3])
# I replace 1 with 100 in list which AdvancedList instance has
x.replace(1, 100)
print(x)
# output:        
# [100, 2, 3, 100, 2, 3, 100, 2, 3]
print(x.desc)    
# upgraded list

@
# Let's talk about __new__() in metaclass
# If class inherits "type", it becomes metaclass
# You can add property and method by using __new__() into class which will be newly created

class name_of_metaclass(type):
    def __new__(metacls, name, bases, namespace):
        code

@
# MakeCalc class inherits "type", so MakeCalc class becomes metaclass
class MakeCalc(type):
    # This __new__() is invoked when you newly create class 
    def __new__(metacls, name, bases, namespace):
        # This adds value of desc attribute into newly created class
        namespace['desc'] = 'calculating class'
        # This add method as lambda expression into newly created class
        namespace['add'] = lambda self, a, b: a + b
        # This invokes __new__() of "base class type"
        return type.__new__(metacls, name, bases, namespace)

# I create Calc class by metaclass MakeCalc
Calc = MakeCalc('Calc', (), {})
# I create instance c of Calc class
c = Calc()
# I print value of desc attribute from Calc instance c
print(c.desc)
# I invoke method which is registered onto attribute of add
print(c.add(1, 2))

@
# __new__() is invoked when you create new class from metaclass as if you do "Calc = MakeCalc('Calc', (), {})"
# Therefore, you can add value of attribute and method onto attribute by using __new__() without using "Calc = MakeCalc('Calc', (), {})" syntanx

# In this case, we tried to add method as lambda expression "lambda self, a, b: a + b"
# But note that, since we should designate 1st parameter as "self", we also designate 1st argument as "self" in lambda expression

@
# Metaclass is mainly used when you control action of class


@
# The following is the way of singleton which always creates only one instance from class

# Singleton class inherits "type", so Singleton class becomes metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    # __instances is attribute on which you will store instance of Singleton class
    __instances = {}
    # This is __call__() which is invoked when you create instance from Singleton class
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        # This code checks if you already created instace from Singleton class
        if cls not in cls.__instances:
            # If you didn't create instance yet from Singleton class,
            # this code create instance and store that instance onto "__instances dictionary"
            cls.__instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        # If you already created instance,
        # this returns created instance which is stored onto "__instances dictionary"                This returns newly created instance                           
        return cls.__instances[cls]

# I create Hello class and I configure metaclass as Singleton class
class Hello(metaclass=Singleton):
    # I do nothing here
    pass
 
# I create instance a from Hello class
a = Hello()     # 클래스 Hello로 인스턴스 a 생성
# I create instance b from Hello class
b = Hello()     
# I check if instance a equals to instance b
print(a is b)
# output:
# true


@
# 1. You create Singleton metaclass which inherits "type"
# 1. You create Hello class with configuring "class Hello(metaclass=Singleton):"
# 1 Metaclass Singleton can control Hello class

@
# __call__() is generally invoked when you invoke instance by using parenthesis
# However, if you implement __call__() inside of metaclass which inherits "type", when you create instance from class(Hello class) which uses metaclass(Singleton class), __call__() is invoked (when you invoke class by parenthesis)


# In this case, when you create instance by using "Hello()", __call__() is invoked in Singleton class
# And in __call__(), it checks if instance already is created or not


@
# Famous example of metaclass is abc.ABCMeta which is explained in "038-006. using abstract class"
# Abstract class which uses abc.ABCMeta should have only list of method
# And derived class from abstract class should implement body of method from list of method
# In other words, metaclass(abc.ABCMeta) controls action of abstract class and its derived class
