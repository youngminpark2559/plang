042-001. generator method, yield<br/>
<xmp>
@
# Generator makes iterator
# Iterator should implement __iter__(), __next__(), __getitem__() in class
# But generator only needs using yield keyword in method
# Therefore, you can make generator much easier than making iterator

@
# In method, if you use yield keyword, that method becomes generator
# And you designame value or variable on yield keyword

def number_generator():
    yield 0
    yield 1
    yield 2
 
for i in number_generator():
    print(i)
# 0
# 1
# 2

@
# Let's see if object which is created via generator is iterator
g = number_generator()
print(g)
# <generator object number_generator at 0x03A190F0>
# dir(g)
# ['__class__', '__del__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__name__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__next__', '__qualname__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'close', 'gi_code', 'gi_frame', 'gi_running', 'gi_yieldfrom', 'send', 'throw']

# If you invoke number_generator(), you're rueturned generator object
# If you explore generator object by invoking dir(), you can see __iter__(), __next__() which you can see in iterator

# Actually, if you invoke __next__() of generator object, you can see StopIteration after displaying 0,1,2
g.__next__()
# 0
g.__next__()
# 1
g.__next__()
# 2
g.__next__()
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<pyshell#29>", line 1, in <module>
    # g.__next__()
# StopIteration


@
# The action of generator is same with iterator
# Like this, you can simply implement iterator by writing yield in method
# The difference is return value of __next__() is returned by return statement in method in case of iterator
# return value of __next__() is returned from designated value of yield keyword in method in case of generator

# Moreover, iterator directly makes StopIteration exception by invoking raise()
# Generator automatically makes StopIteration exception when method reaches end

@
# Generator generates value from yield keyword by executing up to yield code whenever generator object invokes __next__(), so that, generator has name of generator


@
# Let's try to use generator on "for" loop
# Each time of iteration by "for" loop, "for" invokes __next__() to bring generated value from yield
# And "for" terminates iteration when StopIteration occurs because of reaching to end of method


@
# You invoke generator method containing yield keyword
# Then you get "generator object"
# You invoke __iter__() on generator object
# __iter__() returns self instance
# You're returned "generator object"

@
# Let's talk about name of yield keyword
# Why did they give name yield not generate?
# yield means produce and concede
# yield concedes "executing code" to outside, with passing value of yield to outside
# So, that means yield makes method containing yield stop executing but code located in outside of that method execute

@
# Let's try to directly use next() to invoke __next__() instead of "for" iteration


def number_generator():
    # This one transfers 0 to outside, at the same time, this one concedes executing code to outside
    yield 0
    yield 1
    yield 2
 
g = number_generator()
# g is generator object 
# Transferred value from yield is returned from next()
a = next(g)
print(a)
# 0
 
b = next(g)
print(b)
# 1
 
c = next(g)
print(c)       
# 2

@
Tip
# If you reach to end of method, StopIteration exception is occurred in terms of generator
# Since return terminates method, if return is executed in middle of code, StopIteration is also occurred

# If you designate some value on return in generator method, that some value becomes message of StopIteration
def one_generator():
    yield 1
    return 'some_value'
 
try:
    g = one_generator()
    next(g)
    next(g)
except StopIteration as e:
    This prints "some_value"
    print(e)
