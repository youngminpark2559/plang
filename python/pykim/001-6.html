@Chapter
001-6. Regular expression

@
# Regular expression does only 2 task(finding and replacing)

@
# "." means one character
# If I want to find 3 characters, I use "..."

@
# [] means finding "one character" inside of target source text
# With [abc]d, regular expression finds "ad", "bd", "cd"

# It's bothering to manually write each character
# for continuous numbers or continuous alphabets,
# we can use range syntax by using "-"
# For example, [a-z] finds one character from a to z in text
# and [1-9] finds one character from 1 to 9 in text

@
# [^] finds one character
# (which is not included by character which is included inside of[]) in text
# For example, [^abc]d doesn't find ad, bd, cd, 
# and if ed, fd in text, [^abc]d chooses ed, fe

# [^a-z] finds all characters (which are not lowercase alphabet) in text

@
# ^ symbol (outside of []) finds the first of character or line of sentence
# This is rarely used

@
# $ symbol finds the last of character or line of sentence
# This is rarely used

@
# Designating quantity by regular expression

@
# "?" affects one character which is located in front of "?"
# Later, we will use [] in front of "?" to desinate range in front of "?"
# "?" means occurring of 0 time or 1 time
# For example, colou?r finds color and colour


@
# "*" affects one character which is located in front of "*"
# Later, we will use [] in front of "*" to desinate range in front of "*"
# "*" means occurring of all times over 0 time
# For example, ab*c finds ac, abc, abbc, abbbc

@
# "+" affects one character which is located in front of "+"
# Later, we will use [] in front of "+" to desinate range in front of "+"
# "+" means occurring of all times over 1 time
# For example, ab+c finds abc, abbc, abbbc

@
# We can grab stock market site
# by using above regular expression symbol finding patterns in text
# So, we can predict future change of stock by using past data with regular expression
