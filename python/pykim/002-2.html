# Quiz
# You get number ranged from 0 to 3 and assign it to variable count
# Make logic to say greeting as much as times you get as input number
# Consider various kinds of code

# Tip: If you're not using some logics, you can make them as body of method
# because they're not used until you explicitly invoke that method

# Method1

# Following code is not recommended
# Suppose we get number 1 then if statement runs 3 times 
# even if below 2 if statements don't need to be executed

# Multiple if statements can be used
# when you choose multiple values out of multiple conditions

# So, when you choose one value out of multiple values
# you'd better use elif

# Above steps to implement iteration with if, while, etc
# are most important step in learning programming


@
# To use iteration statement well, you should find rule from source

# If we say 1 3 5 7 9 as odd number, it's not good answer
# In programming, answer should be specific
# 1 3 5 7 9     1, 9, 2     starting number 1 , ending number 9, increment or decrement step
# 0 1 2 3 4     0, 4, 1
# 5 4 3 2 1     5, 1, -1
# You can process over 80 percent of source by above rules
# Remainders are difficult jobs to deal with

# Display "hello" 5 times
    i = 1                   # starting
    while i <= 9:           # ending
        print('hello')
        i += 2              # increment and decrement

# Display "hello" 5 times
# Recommended one
    i = 0                   # starting
    while i <= 4:           # ending
        print('hello')
        # Python doesn't use i++
        i += 1              # increment and decrement

# Display "hello" 5 times
    i = 5                   # 시작
    while i >= 1:           # 종료
        print('hello')
        i -= 1              # 증감
