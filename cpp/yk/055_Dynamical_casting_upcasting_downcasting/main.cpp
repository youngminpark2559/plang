// Dynamical casting

// Dynamical means that you do when you need to do in a real time fashion

// Convert an instance type of a sub class into an instance type of a base class
// This is called "upcasting"
// Upcasting doesn't lead to a loss of data

// Converting an instance type of a base class into an instance type of a sub class is "downcasting"
// Downcasting can lead to a loss of data
